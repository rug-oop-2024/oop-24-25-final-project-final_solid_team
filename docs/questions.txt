GW: Will a dataset contain just the data or also already denote the training/validation split?
GW: What is the difference between a database and a dataset?
GW: Do we need to have a dict attribute in an Artifact? It would be logical for a Dataset to be presented to a Database. However, Database takes a dict so maybe Database just get the dict of Dataset. We can postpone this problem because an public member of Artifact will change if we have a dict or not.
